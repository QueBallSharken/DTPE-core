# Security Policy

DTPE-core is designed with explicit constraints and advisory-only behavior.

## Scope

In scope:
- Schema validation weaknesses
- Constraint bypass paths
- Prompt construction that enables unintended autonomy
- Any behavior that violates stated system boundaries

Out of scope:
- Social engineering
- Third-party platform vulnerabilities
- Misuse outside documented configurations

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue:
1. Open a GitHub Issue with a clear description.
2. Include reproduction steps where applicable.
3. Avoid public disclosure until discussion occurs.

DTPE-core prioritizes safety through restraint.
