# DTPE-core — Digital Twin Persona Engine (Core)

DTPE-core is a foundational framework for creating safe, ethical AI “digital twins.”
It models a structured persona from a user’s values, stories, and advisory style to provide guidance, encouragement, and clarity—without copying identity or consciousness.

DTPE does not act.  
DTPE advises.

## What DTPE Is

- A structured, user-controlled persona model
- Deterministic, constrained prompt generation
- Context-aware response shaping
- Explicit ethical and safety boundaries by design
- A foundation intended to be extended only through explicit integration

---

## What DTPE Is Not

- Not surveillance
- Not impersonation
- Not behavioral manipulation
- Not autonomous decision-making
- Not a scoring or reputation system
- Not crypto-dependent

---

## Core Capabilities

- Persona schema definition and validation
- Deterministic and constrained prompt generation
- Context-aware response shaping
- Explicit ethical and safety boundaries
- Local, user-controlled persona files

No black-box personality drift.

## System Boundaries

DTPE:
- Cannot act on behalf of a user
- Cannot punish or enforce behavior
- Cannot evaluate or score other people
- Cannot operate externally without explicit integration

All outputs are advisory only.
