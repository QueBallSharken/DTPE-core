# DTPE-core Design Principles

These principles govern all design decisions within DTPE-core.
They are non-negotiable.

---

## Human Authority First

The human user is always the final decision-maker.
DTPE-core provides guidance, never control.

---

## Advisory-Only Outputs

All system responses are informational.
DTPE-core does not act, enforce, or execute.

---

## Explicit Boundaries

Capabilities and limitations are defined in advance.
There are no hidden behaviors or emergent authority.

---

## Determinism Over Drift

Given the same inputs, DTPE-core behaves consistently.
Persona behavior does not mutate over time.

---

## Transparency by Design

System logic, structure, and constraints are inspectable.
There are no opaque decision processes.

---

## Safety Before Expansion

New capabilities must not compromise human control or clarity.
If a feature risks misuse, it is excluded.

---

## User-Controlled Data

Persona data belongs to the user.
DTPE-core does not centralize or harvest personal data.

---

## Calm Systems Scale Better

DTPE-core is designed to be understandable, restrained, and stable.
Complexity is introduced only when necessary.
